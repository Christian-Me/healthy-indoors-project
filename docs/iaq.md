# the Indoor Air Quality index

*need to be revised. These are only data found in the internet*

## introduction

the IAQ is a artificial index defined by the EPA [(United States Environmental Protection Agency)](https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq). It defines the range from 0-500 in six different categories. The advantage of the IAQ seams to be that many different indices can be mapped into the IAQ Index.

In these project the maximum IAQ is used as an indicator of the Air quality of the room. If necessary the values of different sensors can be weighted to reflect the significance of the sensor type and the relevance of the parameter in the future.

Classification of values of comprehensive indoor air quality indices of different air pollutants into six different groups (i.e., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for sensitive groups, Unhealthy, Very unhealthy, and Hazardous) suggested by EPA
