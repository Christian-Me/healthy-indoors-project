#  Healthy Indoors project

## introduction

I started this project in September 2020 as a reaction of the global COVID-19 epidemic.

The need of an **as healthy as possible** indoor environment became obvious as it became obvious that [the virus is likely to be able to spread via aerosols](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions) which could stay longer in the air and travel further inside rooms as droplets.

Reading this study by [Risk assessment of aerosols loaded with virus based on CO2-concentration](https://blogs.tu-berlin.de/hri_sars-cov-2/wp-content/uploads/sites/154/2020/08/hartmann_kriegel_2020_en_v3.pdf) and many other publications and working in an open space office environment I was wondering if it is possible to develop indicators for the users of the space. As humans are not good in sensing CO2 levels using sensors could be a possible way to help.

As we do not have to fit a [square container in a round canister](https://spacecenter.org/apollo-13-infographic-how-did-they-make-that-co2-scrubber/) if CO2 levels are rising we can simply open the windows. In the beginning of the colder period and higher risk of infections of any kind the question is more when, for how long and if the air exchange is sufficient.

Even without the current covid-19 crises the problem of [health risks factors in indoor environments](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/air-quality/publications/2015/the-school-environment-policies-and-current-status) should be addressed.

## disclaimer

This project do not claim to prevent anybody form dangerous diseases or other harm. Stay distant, wear masks, perform any possible hygienic actions, think about possible ways to avoid long stays indoors, like work from home, remote schooling.

## the Idea

[[graphics/concept-01.svg|concept diagram]]

- develop a sensor network to detect accumulation of CO2 or other indicators
- use multiple sensors to survey larger rooms, find "dead spots" and survey the effects of ventilation, air filters and other methods to improve air quality
- make the project open source that
   - others can participate
   - others can contribute
   - share data and experiences
- raise the awareness of risks in indoor environments
- learn how to improve the air quality and lower the risks with different methods
- test if "self-measured" values can help in communication air quality and perhaps behavior change

## the audience

- everybody who have to stay, study or work in indoor environments
- students who like to build sensor networks, code, analyse the data and perform experiments
- educators who like to teach various aspects form thermo dynamics, electronics, computer science, design, architecture, HVAC systems ... 
- students to get experiences in working on a project remotely using digital techniques like github to exchange ideas and knowlage across borders
